FREETER
=======

This application was designed and built as the main part of my 2012 final dissertation project for my MSc in Electronic Publishing from City University London. 
This is a web-based application that will facilitate collaboration between freelance or small and medium enterprises within a co-working space.
This project idea was proposed by and built for an actual client from whom the application requirements were specified. It is still an on-going work in progress.
